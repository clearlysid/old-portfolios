# Personal Website 2016

> ### 2020 Notes
> Chronologically speaking this was the first website I built centered around my own name, thus qualifying as a "personal website".
> It only existed for a few months on a shady looking cheap domain, on some free hosting platform because I had no idea about GH Pages/Netlify back then.
>
> Made it using some free HTML theme and it served its purpose just fine, acting as a homepage for my Soundcloud and Facebook.
> Neither of which I use at all today and my profiles there have long been sunsetted.
>
> I remember staying up all night to get it live and managed to design, build and deploy the entire thing within a few hours.
>
> I took it down, and re-used the colours/fonts from it to make a "Under Construction" page for my then newly purchased (sniped) https://www.siddharthjha.com somewhere in mid 2017,
> where all my subsequent iterations have lived ever since.
