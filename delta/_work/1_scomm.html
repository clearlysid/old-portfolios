        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p class="lax" data-lax-preset_large="lazy-20">Often times, I overheard my mom complaining to my dad (Yes, both are doctors. And yes, I still chose to not become one) about non-cooperative patients who always cross-checked their diagnosis and compared it to random results from Google, and complained when they didn't fully align.</p>
        <p style="padding-top: 1rem;" class="lax" data-lax-preset_large="lazy-50">When I got the chance to build anything I wanted for a social awareness project, I dived head first into the popular clinic of Dr. Google to see how it was and <a href="https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Case-Study-Using-the-Web-to-obtain-Medical-Information-MMkdg5MqSX0jUBKzAbyvR?_tk=share_copylink" target="_blank" style="font-weight: bold;">here are my findings.</a> Quite a few insights were still to be gathered, but overall I had a good picture of what I wanted to build.</p>

        <h2>Concept</h2>
        <p class="lax" data-lax-preset_large="lazy-20">As an appeal directed to the teenage social-media generation, I decided to create an interactive website which would put the viewer amidst a conversation with a funky, modern doctor who has adopted the all the Gen Z Lingo.</p>
        <p style="padding-top: 1rem;" class="lax" data-lax-preset_large="lazy-50">The conversation would eventually lead to a stern, but playful message as a final 'Doctor's order'. The tone, characters, visuals and narration, all needed to be tailored such that the entire experience has a lasting and memorable impact on the viewer.</p>
