<p>I surveyed about 120 College and High-School students and conducted 6 in-person interviews to further understand what barrier existed between their expenses and their tech.</p>

<p>As always, I logged my readings and findings in this <a href="https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Research-Documentation-Teen-Finances-in-India--Aw3b4PV6mutT4mxkk7fggFsSAQ-thUkzSycJFoN1Gd38NVpt">Research Documentation.</a></p>

<p>The primary pain point reported by most of the students was the sheer amount of effort it took to input a single transaction into their tracker. It was boring, unneccesarily time consuming and more often than not, people would just forget to do it.</p>

<p>There were some overlap of these answers and there were also some people who said they do track their finance but aren’t content with the way they currently do it.</p>

<h2 id="user-persona">User Persona</h2>

<p>Rajeev is a 20 year old BBA fresher. He has just started to realize the importance of personal finance as he now has to manage expenses himself. He also wants to buy a motorbike.</p>

<p>To ensure I didn’t get sidetracked, I kept my goals simple but clear: To help Rajeev</p>

<ul>
    <li>Track his spending</li>
    <li>Set, and stick to, a Budget</li>
    <li>Improve his financial literacy (secondary)</li>
</ul>

<p>A conversation is much easier to follow along than a spreadsheet. What if, instead of terms like: income, expenses, debt, etc…we simply opt for the user to fill out the sentence: “I spent <strong>___ at __</strong>_ on _____”. This would help take a heavy cognitive burden on the user while still gathering all the required inputs…</p>
