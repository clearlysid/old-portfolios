description:
  - Despite access to so many expense-tracking platforms, I was intrigued by how most teens in the country didn’t use any of them. In this project, I set out to find the reasons why  …and hopefully fix them if I could.

  - “Simply Spent” is an app concept, aimed at providing a frictionless experience tracking day to day transactions for young adults in India. I'm still working on some prototypes, so please keep an eye on this page for more!

## User Research

I surveyed about 120 College and High-School students and conducted 6 in-person interviews to further understand what barrier existed between their expenses and their tech.

As always, I logged my readings and findings in this [Research Documentation.](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Research-Documentation-Teen-Finances-in-India--Aw3b4PV6mutT4mxkk7fggFsSAQ-thUkzSycJFoN1Gd38NVpt)

## Insights

The primary pain point reported by most of the students was the sheer amount of effort it took to input a single transaction into their tracker. It was boring, unneccesarily time consuming and more often than not, people would just forget to do it.

There were some overlap of these answers and there were also some people who said they do track their finance but aren't content with the way they currently do it.



## User Persona

Rajeev is a 20 year old BBA fresher. He has just started to realize the importance of personal finance as he now has to manage expenses himself. He also wants to buy a motorbike.

To ensure I didn't get sidetracked, I kept my goals simple but clear: To help Rajeev

<ul>
    <li>Track his spending</li>
    <li>Set, and stick to, a Budget</li>
    <li>Improve his financial literacy (secondary)</li>
</ul>

## Solution

A conversation is much easier to follow along than a spreadsheet. What if, instead of terms like: income, expenses, debt, etc...we simply opt for the user to fill out the sentence: "I spent _____ at _____ on _____". This would help take a heavy cognitive burden on the user while still gathering all the required inputs...
