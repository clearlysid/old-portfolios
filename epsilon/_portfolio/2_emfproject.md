    - The International EMF Project is an initiative by the World Health Organization to assess possible health concerns on exposure to Electromagnetic Frequencies.

    - I built an animated explainer which introduces the project, highlights the need for it, its functions and goals.

## Design Brief

This project was fairly research oriented, and was derived from a much broader assignment brief. For more information on the background of this project, feel free to view my [research documentation.](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Research-Documentation.--Av939vrYPGJk3ImBB~Cr2vnPAQ-fgwgKyoNShoAuNjR4PEjg)


## Problem + Concept

On the first visit, the [homepage](https://who.int/emf) of the EMF Project does not immediately inform visitors about what the project is. To fix this, I decided to create an "elevator pitch" for it by building a short motion infographic.

I decided to condense my pitch to no more than 90 seconds and started working on the script. For this project, an authoritative, but neutral tone of voice was needed.

## Storyboarding and Scripting

Scene by scene, I loosely sketched out how the script will play out and described the animations. Visualizing different ways of presenting information and working out the transitions. My main goal was to explore how information could be conveyed by basic geometric shapes and typography using motion.

## Visual Style

Simultanously, I also started to think about the colours, typography and other visual elements I would use in the project. I quickly mocked up a few scenes in Adobe Illustrator and focused on styling them as they would appear in the final product.

## Animation Sequences

I had a lot of fun during this phase of the project as I got to to practise all the fundamentals of animation that I had been learning for a while. In fact, After Effects started to feel familiar now, instead of daunting. Here are some of the sequences that I built for the explainer

## My Takeaways

This short project pushed me to study and explore a completely unknown space, find a problem that can be solved with the help of design and conceptualize a solution that could be implemented. And while I was fairly happy with the fidelity of my outcome, I think it does very little to help the situation that could otherwise be a very impactful campaign driven by design.
