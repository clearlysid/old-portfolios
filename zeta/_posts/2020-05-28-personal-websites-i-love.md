I love looking at how people set up their online presence. This is the first edition of an ongoing list of websites which I think are great examples of people putting themselves online. I'll share my best findings once every couple of months or so, as and when the list is long enough.

### [Ansh Mehra](http://anshmehra.com){:target="_blank"}

Ansh's portfolio has had to tackle the challenge of being able to show an incredible 'breadth' of skill, not just a few related ones, they range from Hackathons he's participated in, to UX Design, Filmmaking, Vlogs and even Tutorials. I think he does a great job of laying it all out in a very simple, conventional manner allowing viewers to explore a diverse set of his projects and experiences at their leisure.

### [Abhishek Jha](https://abhishekjha.me){:target="_blank"}

On the other hand, one look at this page and you instantly know that Abhishek can craft extremely polished websites and he's very good at what he does, which is Web Development and Design. Right within the first fold Abhishek wins you over with a fancy yet functional layout making great use of contrasting type-sizes and complementary animations, a theme which is prominent across the entire website.

### [Kovid Goyal](https://kovidgoyal.net){:target="_blank"}

This one is a unique website which captures the Internet exactly as it was in the 90's. While not a 'Design Portfolio' in a conventional sense, it still does a great job of showcasing the creators work, offering a glimpse at his personality and skillset and all this while taking us on a nostalgic walk down the memory lane. It's a real piece of art in my opinion, and while it's not everyone's cup of tea, I'm glad Kovid still keeps it as-is to this day.

### [Divya Kant](https://divyakant.in){:target="_blank"}

While DK is quite comfortable with code himself he still choose to build his own portfolio using Notion, choosing to focus his efforts on the content and less on the site stack itself. Consistent illustrations for each page make the experience of browsing feel polished and his case studies offer a clear look into his thought process. Great work!

### [Arjun Phlox](https://phlox.life){:target="_blank"}

Phlox Life is a modest writing space with a very simple card-style navigation and an beautifully written story of Arjun's life in Design so far. I'm looking forward to reading a lot more there as Arjun keep publishing.

## My Takeaways

I loved the simplicity of Arjun's website and how it's no-frills approach basically means that the site exists only to add value to others and perhaps to Arjun himself. It doesn't try to sell you any product, it doesn't overwhelm you with work. It simply exists, waiting for you to read it. Reading Arjun's story was part of what pushed me to share my own experiences as well.

Ansh, Abhishek and Divya all make extensive use of other platforms like Behance and Dribbble to supplement their websites. In Abhishek's case, the website itself is simply a landing page that acts as a gateway to his Behance case studies. I quite like this approach and will try to take it up as well, but only concern is that the more outlets I manage, the harder it gets to keep them all up to date.

> Here, I personally suggest following the 80/20 rule. Pick two platforms to spend 80% of your effort on, and leave only 20% for the rest.

One step at a time. Thankfully, doing this exercise means that the steps are a bit clearer to me going forward. Will keep updating my blog as I go.

Cheers!
