# Note (from 2020)

> This repo contains my very first draft (in an ongoing series) of my personal website. It served me well all the way from purchasing the domain in 2017 to actually getting to build the site in 2018. Clearly I was into a lot of colours back then!

> everything below is untouched and kept as-is from 2017.
