> ### Note (from 2020)
>
> This repo contains my very first draft (in an ongoing series) of my personal website. It served me well all the way from purchasing the domain in 2017, to actually getting to build the site in 2018. Clearly I was into a lot of colours back then!

> Also note, at this point in time I had absolutely zero idea how Github worked and remember creating a new repo for literally every single change I made to the project xD
